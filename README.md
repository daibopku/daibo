## Bo Dai

I am a postdoc majored in AI at Peking University.  Currently, I work at [*Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence*](https://www.bigai.ai/), advised by [*Prof. Song-Chun Zhu* ](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/). Before coming to Bigai, I graduated with a Ph.D. in Physics from Peking University.

### Research

My research interests lie on Intuitive Theory in Cognitive Science. Currently, I work with [*Yixin Zhu*](https://www.yzhu.io/) on Violation of Expectation (VoE) projects for intuitive physics.

Intuitive physics is not really physics, but refers to the initial and fundamental human cognition of the world. I focus on how to build a machine to learn intuitive physical knowledge with human-like performance. This research not only helps to build a machine that thinks like a people, but also helps us to learn more about possible human cognitive simulations.
